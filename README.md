The beginnings of a game with complex gesture recognizers

So far, my intention is to create a custom gesture recognizer (FireGestureRecognizer) with an initial downward motion, followed by a diagonal upward/leftward motion, then a rightward motion cossing over the initial downward motion. This is meant to play the game by drawing a glyph or series of glyphs to cast spells. I have not been formally trained in coding, so any advice on how to best improve anything, particularly the gesture recognizer, would be most welcome.
